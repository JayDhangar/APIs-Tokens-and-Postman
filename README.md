Practice: Call an API to generate text, handle tokens (e.g., API keys).
Task 1: Set up Postman and make a GET request to a public API (e.g., JSONPlaceholder).
Task 2: Use Postman to send a POST request with JSON data to your local Flask app.
Task 3: Build GET, POST, PUT, DELETE Flask API and test it on Postman.
Task 4: Add Bearer Token authentication to your Flask API.
Task 5: Fetch user info from a public API (e.g., GitHub user profile endpoint).
Task 6: Create a Flask API that takes a number and returns its square via POST method.
